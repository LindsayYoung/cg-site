These tools address different and complementary models to the platform-as-a-service workflow of cloud.gov, like domain microservices and service discovery.

Our research suggests government agencies aren’t typically in a state where they’re ready for broad and direct deployment of services using those models. The PaaS model is better suited to the most common problems we observed in government agencies today.

That said, these are powerful tools. cloud.gov may incorporate them in the future, either by exposing them directly, or building services on top of them. cloud.gov will adopt this technology when it emerges as the best way to provide a capability that’s necessary to deliver a project. Meanwhile we will continue to watch as the community and standards (for example, the Open Container Initiative) develop.
