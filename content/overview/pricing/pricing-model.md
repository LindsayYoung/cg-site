cloud.gov services are available to other agencies on a _full_ cost-recovery model.

---

The current cloud.gov pricing model has three components:

- Access package
- Resource usage
- Managed services

Find out more about each component via our [pricing terminology page]({{< relref "overview/terminology/pricing-terminology.md" >}}) or see the [dedicated page with our rates]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md" >}}).

Our mission is broader than making it easier for government agencies to adopt cloud deployment. The mission of cloud.gov is to enable agencies to deliver services to the public as fast as they can develop them while applying best practices in security and compliance with minimal effort.

Comparing cloud.gov’s pricing model to private Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers is difficult, as it is not an apples to apples comparison. A price comparison would include the up-front and opportunity costs of procurement, operations, security, and compliance teams in obtaining a solution. These costs can be difficult to isolate, especially if they are covered by various working capital funds in your agency.

cloud.gov avoids many of these costs and delivers a proven, ready-to-ATO infrastructure to your teams’ hands on day one via an Inter-agency Agreement (IAA). cloud.gov’s resource usage is already priced competitively with the private market, and is the superior option in reducing compliance friction to access the cloud.

cloud.gov’s pricing model is an ongoing experiment. Whether it fits the needs of federal agencies is still being validated. The cloud.gov promise to partner agencies is that prices will not change on them mid-fiscal year, and the price of any particular part of the platform will *not go up*.

The model _itself_ may change between fiscal years, but those changes will not apply to existing paid users. cloud.gov honors the pricing model for access _during_ the IAA’s period of performance, and will not change the model for any particular partner until their IAA’s period of performance is over.
