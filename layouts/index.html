        The cloud.gov platform’s flexible, machine-readable, always up-to-date compliance documentation automates huge parts of the ATO process. Imagine a secure cloud environment where your team can get up and running in minutes, then build, manage, and release applications — with platform compliance built in. This is cloud.gov.

        <p>
          To get the benefits of cloud hosting, like scalability and savings, you need cloud
          operations expertise, unless you’re using a Platform as a Service like cloud.gov.
          cloud.gov takes care of those operations and gives you easy-to-use tools to manage
          access, resource usage, monitoring, and other services. It’s flexible enough to give you
          what you need without sticking you with what you don’t. Let your team focus on building
          the applications you’re responsible for.

      <div class="three_up-part three_up-part-2">
        <h3 class="section-coltitle">Make compliance easier. Give your team their time back.</h3>
        <p>
          Launching digital applications for a federal agency requires lengthy documentation
          detailing your compliance with security standards. Creating these docs takes dozens of
          hours from developers, hours they can’t spend building features your users need. But
          with cloud.gov, you get Compliance as a Service, too. Use the platform’s flexible,
          machine-readable, always up-to-date documentation to automate huge parts of the process.
          Just document what you build on top of the platform. Could your team use the extra time?

      <div class="three_up-part three_up-part-3">
        <h3 class="section-coltitle">Take advantage of centrally-managed security.</h3>
        <p>
          Because cloud.gov enforces a consistent environment, no other team using the platform
          can change the environment in a way that hurts your security or compliance. Because
          every update applies to every application running on the platform, your team benefits
          from every improvement. Because we update the environment by deploying a whole new
          system instead of modifying a live system, any foothold bad actors might have found is wiped
          away.
